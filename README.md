            <span class="must">data-sg-type=&quot;bar-horizontal-css&quot;</span><br/>
            <span class="must">data-sg-width=&quot;400&quot;</span><br/>
            <span class="must">data-sg-height=&quot;100&quot; </span><br/> 
            <span class="must">data-sg-value=&quot;0.10,0.24,0.52,0.78,0.44,0.98&quot;</span>&gt;<br/>
            &lt;/div&gt;
"

data-sg-type="bar-horizontal-css" --> there are 2 types for now bar => bar-horizontal-css OR bar-vertical-css

data-sg-width="400" data-sg-height="100"  --> adjust your width or height as you want

data-sg-value="0.10,0.24,0.52,0.78,0.44,0.98" -->  value here is graph value from 0.00 ~ 1.00
